# Traffic-Sign-Classification

We started with downloading the dataset, preprocessing it, created the model and found out the predictions using the model. During preprocessing we found that this dataset has 43 classes. Model reached an accuracy of 95%+ in just 50 epochs, we can further optimize the model using hyper parameter tuning and reach a higher accuracy.

### Classes 
    "Speed limit (20km/h)",
    "Speed limit (30km/h)",
    "Speed limit (50km/h)",
    "Speed limit (60km/h)",
    "Speed limit (70km/h)",
    "Speed limit (80km/h)",
    "End of speed limit (80km/h)",
    "Speed limit (100km/h)",
    "Speed limit (120km/h)",
    "No passing",
    "No passing for vechiles over 3.5 metric tons",
    "Right-of-way at the next intersection",
    "Priority road",

    "No vechiles",
    "Vechiles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited",
    "No entry",
    "General caution",
    "Dangerous curve to the left",
